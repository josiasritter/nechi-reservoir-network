# nechi-reservoir-network
This repository contains the operational model of the reservoir network in the Nech√≠ catchment, Colombia, and a decision-making component for simulating operational strategies depending on 12 optimization parameters. The models and their results are documented in detail in the following publication: "Multiobjective Direct Policy Search Using Physically Based Operating Rules in Multireservoir Systems" - Ritter, Corzo, Solomatine and Angarita (2020), Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management: https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001159
