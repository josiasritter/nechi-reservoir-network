# nechi-reservoir-network
This repository contains Matlab code describing an operational model of the reservoir network in the Nech√≠ catchment, Colombia, and a behavioural component for simulating operational strategies depending on 12 optimization parameters. The codes have been used for generating the results documented in the following publication: "Multiobjective Direct Policy Search Using Physically Based Operating Rules in Multireservoir Systems" - J. Ritter, G. Corzo, D.P. Solomatine, H. Angarita (2020)
